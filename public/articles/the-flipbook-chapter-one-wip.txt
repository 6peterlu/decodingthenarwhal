BEEP BEEP. I snoozed it reflexively. Centuries of technology, and here we were, still getting up to alarm clocks. Opening my eyes was still a nervous process for me, even though it had been a month since the incident that dropped my job tier into the dumps. Literally the dumps, separating garbage into recyclable and non-recyclable. I didn’t even wake up in a bedroom that time, just the couch next to some empty beer bottles. And a hangover. It was an interesting side effect, hangovers. The number of times I woke up with a hangover had to multiplied at least ten times since the Flipbook was put into place. A petition had been opened to transfer physical effects across bodies, but it could be months before that made it into implementation. Still, I tried to avoid subjecting my next body mate to unnecessary suffering in that way.
My conclusion on the alarm clocks were that they were there to enforce a sense of continuity, just like our names, which we retained even though our body switching occasionally moved us into a body with a different gender. At first, it was jarring for me to see a man saunter into the shop with the name “Diane” in pixelated lights on his tag, and I somehow felt bad for him, as if he had been transplanted from his body more than the rest of us. But we were all in the same boat, and that’s how Aamina designed it.
Before I opened my eyes, I focused on the weight of my body against the mattress, and the weight of the blanket on my skin. I breathed in deeply. The air felt dry and crisp in my lungs, and had the faintest smell of ashes. That didn’t tell me much. Unless you ended up in a farming job or one of the bottom rung assignments, all of the work was at or near the urbanized city-like center of the Ark, which was informally designated as the Hive because of the sheer number of delivery drones that buzzed about from building to building. If I focused, I could hear some of them outside my window. Definitely in the Hive.
BEEP BEEP. I opened my eyes, turned off the alarm, unplugged my Link, and opened the nightstand display. It read:
Your Flipbook assignment for today is drone control firmware engineer.
You have the following objectives:
1. Complete your assigned programming tasks.
2. Give a metrics update to Mary from product.
3. Help your coworker Lucas debug their memory leak issue.
After work, you need to
1. replenish the groceries in your fridge according to the grocery list there.
2. Clean the bathroom.
3. Call a repairman to fix the shower.
As with all Flipbook jobs, your check in time at work is 8am.
Underneath the header, the Flipbook helpfully displayed the weather forecast as well as the indoor climate control setting for my job.
Not bad. Since the garbage sorting job I had paid much more attention to my performance scores day to day and gotten a desk job for a few weeks in a row. Of course, I would prefer to have a job where I could get some air every now and again, but those were few and far between and I needed to exceed expectations by a mile to get that kind of upgrade. I went to the bathroom and peered into the mirror. A black haired, green eyed, freckled face stared back at me. I smiled once with teeth, and once without, to see which looked better on me. I found that varied more than I originally thought, so recently I had been focused on getting that resolved earlier in the day.
Above the front door, as always, was a timer. “Capsule arriving in 60 seconds.” I put on a dark blue turtleneck from the closet and some jeans and opened the door. I did not grow up in the Hive, and having been here for only a few years, the sight was still breathtaking. Makeshift skyscrapers stretched far above and below me, oriented radially outward from the center of gravity in the middle of the ship. Most of the residential towers in the hive were stacked, modular apartments, hastily produced in the decade of construction scrambling when the Ark was constructed. From afar, the Ark looked like an explosion, frozen in place. Between these skyscrapers a tangle of wires were connected, each corresponding to a capsule route. Silently, a glass capsule paused in front of me, and the door slid open. The capsule was only about half full, and people parted to let me enter. Behind me, the door automatically shut, and we were off.
Although humans invented fully autonomous self-driving technology before the Ark was built, the AI systems were not generalizable to be repurposed to the three dimensional structure of the Hive, so the Hive’s internal transport system was essentially analogous to that of a train, with tracks extending to the doorway of each person’s home. From there, people could ride in the train cars, made from a clear glass material to any destination within the Hive. Getting places was slow because of the number of stops, but very predictable, and in a world where everyone’s lives were being exchanged every day, predictability was of the utmost importance. Without a fully predictable transport system, it would not be possible for the workforce in the Hive to reliably arrive at work at 8am, and thus most likely cause many unavoidable performance violations.
Before long, my pod was full, and we were speeding along without stops to the center of the Hive. In contrast to the vast apartment complexes gradually falling into disarray, the business center remained brightly painted and well maintained. As if to make up for the vast sea of oxidizing greys and reds in the rest of the Hive, the business center was a montage of punchy primary colors, standing out even more against the blackness of space beyond. We called it the Rainbow. Entering the Rainbow every day was when I felt the beehive metaphor the strongest — as far as I could see, clear capsules filled with every working age person in the Hive swarmed to their respective garishly colored buildings.
The display on my Visor, a corneal implant installed in most Hive workers, awakened. “The next stop is yours, Yasin,” it read. The capsule paused, and I stepped out of it directly into the air conditioned foyer of my workplace for the day. A few others followed me off the capsule. In the lobby, a facial recognition system checked each of our faces, marking us as present for the day. Although I had not had this exact role before, I did recognize the building. The lobby looked almost like that of a bank or train station, with a wide counter beneath an arching marble ceiling. On either side of the mahogany counter were two sealed metal doors with fingerprint sensors. As I approached the door, my Visor alerted me again: “Building restriction: no tailgating.” I waited for the door to seal shut after the person in front of me before scanning my thumbprint. “Welcome, Yasin. Hope you have a productive and fulfilling day today,” said the door.
The lobby may have looked like an old fashioned bank, but the interior was anything but. This was the room where the hardware engineers worked to design and optimize the chips that went into the Hummingbird cargo delivery drones flitting about outside. Even in my parents time in university, electrical engineering was a microscale endeavor, with engineers spending their time hunched over tiny chips and computer screens, trying to squeeze out the final drops of Moore’s law. That changed dramatically with the introduction of quantum transistors, capable of delivering information exponentially more efficiently through superposition states. One huge implication of the introduction of quantum transistors is that chip architectures became much more complicated, and a better interface was needed to design them. Much in the same way that the graphical desktop made file manipulation on personal computers leaps and bounds easier, interactable holographic technology became an essential part of any chip design toolkit. On the Ark, there was exactly one chip manufacturer, Qubex. Qubex’s holographic area resembled the IMAX movie theater domes of old, but scaled up to the size of many football fields. Lining the walls were holographic projectors, maintaining minimal latency holograms of various chip components and architectures below. Scattered around the area were large, house sized virtual models of each chip. Those were mostly for show, but every piece of the model could be cloned and brought back to any individual engineers’ work area if deemed necessary.
The last time I was here, I was on one of the upper floors, maintaining the holographic equipment. It struck me that I probably saw the body I was currently in on the ground floor. Reflexively, I looked up toward the high railings spiraling up the domed ceiling, squinting to catch a glance of the shadowy workers behind the bright spotlights powering the holograms. It was a futile exercise. I was already not very good with faces even as a child, and entering the Flipbook had certainly not made that any easier.
I was thankful to live in an era where chip engineering no longer took place at a desk or cubicle. Every workstation was instead configured more like a woodworking shop, with parts littered everywhere. When I entered my work area, my Visor informed me that my goal for today was to propose a few designs for improving the power efficiency of the collision avoidance subsection. I looked at the various tubes and wiring in front of me, and weighed each in my hand. Even though they were virtual objects, the feeling of cool, dense silicon was generated by my Cortex, the chip implanted into every member of the Flipbook. It was what enabled the separation of skills and personality, of muscle memory and emotional memory. I patted my head gratefully. The Cortex was a previously forbidden piece of technology, I had learned during my youth classes, that was only available to the extremely wealthy for entertainment purposes. It seemed incredible that every Flipbook member had access to it, automatically implanted at the young age of ten. The Cortex was the hardware upon which the Flipbook software could run.
Looking down at the layout of the components at my feet, I recognized some of the patterns as legacy transistor architectures that had been obsoleted in a research paper from last week, and by updating those to the state of the art designs, I was able to squeeze out a few percentage points of power efficiency. Chip engineering was a tactile experience, and I spent most of my morning trying different configurations of my local architecture, almost as if the pieces were stubborn Legos. When my Visor alerted me that my lunch break was here, I still sat amid a pile of parts strewn about the pristine mirrored floor. “Would you like to eat in the cafeteria or have your food delivered here?”
“Delivered,” I said. The menu floated in front of me, and I poked at the words “Carne asada burrito”. The menu floated away and I saw an order progress bar, letting me know my order would be arriving in five minutes. I always had my food delivered when I had the option. I didn’t see much point in idle chatter with coworkers I would probably not see again, and certainly not in the same bodies. Instead, I read the latest Flipbook update releases.
“We’re considering adding nutritional value guidelines to the daily objectives,” it read. “Please leave any comments you have below, we look forward to hearing your feedback.”
There were over a million comments. Everyone read the Flipbook updates.
“I don’t get why the Flipbook team thinks we don’t need some space in our lives outside of work to enjoy ourselves,” one comment read. “I think this makes a lot of sense, it’s unfair for some of us to pay for the poor dietary decisions of others,” said another. There were few updates that were not tremendously controversial, but I saw all the debate and controversy as a breath of fresh air. It felt like as long as there was discussion, it meant people cared about making the Flipbook better. Which made sense, because it was our whole lives now.
A Hummingbird dropped my burrito in front of me and I munched on it while scrolling through the rest of the update feed. I wondered if I might not be able to indulge in cheesy, oily burritos for much longer, and ate it a little slower, savoring each bite. Then, it was back to work.

“Hey, thanks so much Yasin, I couldn’t have done it without your help,” Lucas called gratefully after me. Debugging always took longer than expected, and the sunlight glowing through the front doors was tinged with red.
“No problem, my pleasure.” I asked the front desk to clock me out, and stepped out into grainy air of the Hive. Even though the air inside was certainly cleaner, I had grown to love the smell of the Hive. It gave me a sense of liveliness and energy that no amount of filtered conditioned ventilation could. After a couple of minutes, a capsule slid in front of me. “Where to?” My cortex asked, relaying the capsule’s question.
“Grocery store, please.” Most people on the Ark simply had groceries delivered to their homes, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of browsing actual shelves. It was a practice I started a few years ago, to remind myself that I was a different person, in a different place, every day. I think I would go crazy if I just saw the same couple digital Cortex displays, and they just had slightly different words on them. Sometimes, people did go crazy. I was the only person in my capsule to go to the grocery store. Everyone else was going home.
The nearest grocery store to me today was a hole-in-the-wall affair, sandwiched between two imposing business centers. There were few customers inside. The Ark contained no large grocery stores, like the Costcos back on Planet Earth. A vast majority of the food was stored in large central distribution warehouses, and delivered directly to people’s residences. The few grocery stores that remained were much like this one, containing the bare minimum of each item on the shelves and needing to be constantly restocked from the central foodstore. Today, the tomato shelf was empty. I approached the only employee in the store. Her name tag was a different color than mine, glowing with blue light to my red. Here on the Ark, different colors indicated different types of professions. I still hadn’t committed the meanings of the colors to memory. Her name tag read: Tamara.
“Excuse me Tamara, I was wondering if you knew if there were any tomatoes in stock?” There was no such thing as in stock, as any grocery store could replenish near immediately from the central food store, but I preferred to imagine otherwise. She understood.
“Let me check our back room and let you know.” As the door to the storage area clicked shut behind her, I felt a sense of deja vu. Something about this place, maybe the smell? I breathed in deeply and looked around in more detail. An old analog sign hung above each shelf, stating “Produce” or “Poultry” or “Frozen foods”. My Cortex overlaid my vision with the locations of all my foods in the store. I turned off the display. Nothing jogged my memory.
“It’s your lucky day, I found some in the back!” Tamara’s cheerful voice jolted me. “Here you are.”
“Thanks a bunch.” I received the box of tomatoes from her. I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that had set in since I arrived here, but time was wasting, so I turned my Cortex back on and quickly gathered the rest of my goods. There was no need for currency in the Flipbook since the system was aware of all resource allocations, so I made my way to the door. “Have a great night!”
She looked up from her counter briefly. “You as well, Yasin.” I stepped back outside into a waiting capsule. As I turned back to enter my home address, I saw Tamara flipping the open sign to closed on the storefront, looking at me. Her eyebrows were wrinkled with confusion. Before I could react, my capsule sped off.
=====
I glanced at my time display. 9:42pm. I liked to go for long walks near my place of residence each night, to see if I could understand anything about the person I was assigned to be, before I was whisked off. There were no sidewalks on the Ark, but enclosed walkways about ten feet wide connected every home to local park areas and such. The walls were clear, so much like a capsule, I could look out onto the tangle of the Hive. About every hundred meters or so, there was an emergency hatch that allowed people to crawl out onto the outside of a walkway, but that left an individual at risk of falling off toward the gravity well at the center of the Ark. Besides the occasional repairman, I had never seen anyone out there. Here in the residential areas, there was a lot more piping of water and electricity to all of the various prefab home containers. The sun had nearly set and I could see the sparkles of stars all around in the blackness of space. I wondered what the Ark would be like once it had floated far enough away from the Sun to be enveloped in darkness. We’d need to develop some sort of artificial sunrise and sunset. If we made it that far, this Ark project would already be a success beyond anything we could have dreamed only a few centuries ago. In many ways, it already was.
“Do you remember any interactions I’ve had with anyone named Tamara before?” I asked my Cortex as I walked.
Instantly, it replied. “You have not had any interactions with anyone named Tamara before.”
My Cortex was an all-knowing piece of equipment. It saw everything I saw, with more perfect memory and knowledge and understanding powered by all the content on the internet. There were countless instances where I had been wrong and my Cortex had corrected me. Yet, I knew in this moment, my Cortex was wrong. I ran the name over and over in my head as I walked.
When I returned to my apartment, it was only twenty minutes before plug-in at 11. It was an innocuous time, but failing to plug in opened up a scary world of the Nightwatch, which I hoped never to interact with. I half-heartedly mopped up the bathroom, and with my final 5 minutes, I left the next inhabitant a note:
“Good morning!
Whoever you are, I hope you’re able to get up on the right side of the bed today and have a great one. I’m rooting for you!
~ Yasin, your previous inhabitant”
I was almost certain the Nightwatch cleaned up any attempts at communication across consciousnesses, but it made me feel happy to think the notes would actually go through, and I had no way of knowing one way or the other. Thus far, no one had stopped me on the street to say thanks for the note, and perhaps no one ever would, but I left a note every night just the same.
10:59pm. My alarm clock blinked angrily at me. I hopped into bed and tapped the Link to the external port of the Cortex at the top of my head. It magnetized into place, and I laid there, watching the clock.
11:00pm. My vision switched off, like a light.
