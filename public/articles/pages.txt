<i>Page 1: It’s the waning days of summer, where the sun, seemingly aware it will soon be hidden behind a curtain of clouds, burns with its greatest heat and brightness of the year. You see Misty running through the yard, a fluffy lightning bolt streaking back and forth, following the cars driving by on the other side of the fence. The air smells like freshly mowed grass. When she is finally tired out, she flops down onto her belly, her paws green with chlorophyll.

<i>Page 2: You don’t have a Palm Pixi yet. You will get one that fall, after an extensive explanation to your parents about why you absolutely need a smartphone. Your reasons don’t really make sense to them, and you know that, They eventually buy you one anyway. Go to page 5.

Wait, I want to try that again. Go to page 1.

<i>Page 4: You leave the comfort of your shade on the patio to sit in the yard with Misty. The direct sunlight beats down on you both, and you wonder why she chooses to lie down here instead of on the cool concrete. You ask her this. She pants back at you. It’s a shame the sunlight of summer disappears right when summer vacation ends, you think. The good things of the year should be spread out more evenly. The breeze ripples across the lawn, and you feel as if you are sitting in a green ocean, with waves lapping all around you. Go to page 5.

Okay. I like that better. Page 5, please.

<i>Page 5: Cardboard boxes are strewn around your room. You wonder how it is even possible to move a house’s worth of objects from one place to another. Dust floats in the air from all the untouched objects and surfaces, now disturbed. A cup of pens sits on your nightstand. You tentatively take one and scribble on a stray journal with it. It’s dry, tracing invisible spirals across the page, so you toss it into the trash bin in the corner of the room. Next to your pen cup you see your Palm Pixi. You don’t use it anymore, but you think the charger is still around somewhere.

<i>If you pack it, flip to page 6.

<i>Page 7: You pack for a few more hours, and head downstairs for some water. Your dog has been put out into the yard, for the ease of the moving process. Mostly, she lays in the grass, her ears perking up when cars go by. Occasionally, she’ll chase a rabbit who has strayed into the yard, until it disappears into the small hole under our fence. Go to page 8.

<i>Page 8: You’re moving to New York tomorrow. Tina, your best friend, is staying here in Colorado. She’s sitting across from you, in the cafe you two always go to. Even so, you haven’t been here in months, and neither has she. They’ve remodeled the back patio, transforming worn wooden oak to shiny glass and metal. Inside, everything is like it’s never changed, down to the soft pop playlist that never gets updated. You and Tina sit at the couches near the fireplace, which is off, because it’s late August, but it gives you that cozy feeling anyways.
<i>You both recall the time that you first met, randomly assigned to the same assignment group in psych class. You’re surprised she recalls it at all, because nothing came of it. You didn’t talk again for another year, but perhaps much like you, she also retroactively assigned some importance to that day. Then choosing to be in her section for your nature field trip, just because you didn’t recognize anyone else in the class, and it was cold outside and it seemed much more comfortable to look at plant cells under microscopes than identifying microorganisms in freezing creek water.
<i>Friendships, to you, were never some gradual filling of a memory tank up to a requisite level of closeness. They were strikes against a matchbox. Sometimes it happened on the first strike, and sometimes, as with Tina, it took a while. You always wondered if those past strikes mattered at all, those defective matchsticks.
<i>Of course, the day that your friendship burst into existence is a story that you’ve retold to each other so many times it feels like a personal cliche, about how she, stranded at the airport because her flight was cancelled, posted about her frustration on Facebook, and you, with a particularly empty afternoon, went and drove her home. You were more bored than anything. It makes you wonder if you should focus on being bored more often.
<i>You talk for hours, exchanging stories, dreams. Sometimes life gives you an excuse to do that. You wonder why you don’t do it more often. You realize that you’re in love. Too quickly, the sun goes down.
<i>“I still can’t believe it’s your last day here. We have to keep in touch.”

<i>Page 10: It’s tricky to find a time that works with your busy college schedules, along with the time difference, but you make it work. 8PM Eastern on Sundays. For the first few months, you can’t wait for Sundays. The stories are overflowing, and on the calls they tumble out of you, like a swift mountain stream going over a waterfall. Tina’s life is much quieter back at home, and she tunes in eagerly, writing down all the new names that come into your life each week and asking about them.
<i>Go to page 12.
-----
<i>Page 12: During your first winter break back at home, you ask her on a date, and she says yes. For a few weeks, you two spend nearly every waking hour with each other. You’ll never forget it. Yet, the more time you spend in college, the more you grow apart, and eventually you both decide it’s best to move on as friends. Later, she starts seeing someone back at home, and your life in New York settles down. There’s less to talk about. Sundays become less sacred. Sometimes you have midterms to study for instead. Sometimes, she has a dinner date planned.
<i>Eventually, you stop talking altogether. It happens so gradually, you don’t even notice it, and by the time you do, it doesn’t bother you too much.
<i>Go to page 13.

Well, that was unexpected. Okay, next page.

<i>Page 13: The stream of comments on your draft feels endless. You lean back in your chair and rub your eyes wearily. You head downstairs to get a glass of water, then retreat back to your room for some more screen staring. Some of the edits are easy, just grammatical changes, but the rest make you question why you wrote the essay in the first place.

<i>If you decide to take a walk to clear your mind, go to page 14.
<i>If you keep writing, go to page 15.

Definitely page 14.

<i>Page 14: You stand up and stretch your limbs. None of your housemates are awake yet, and the house is silent. You sneak outside into the oblique morning sunlight. The dew shimmers in the grass at your feet. You walk slow circles on the sidewalk that surrounds the lawn, and it reminds you of Misty chasing cars and rabbits. As you take deep breaths of oxygen and sunshine, it comes to you, the idea for a story. It feels as new as the morning. You go inside, back to your computer.

<i>Page 17: You close your last draft. There’s a whole folder of these, sitting untouched in your Google drive. Inspiration strikes rarely, you think, so you quickly write down the essentials of your new story. Later that day, you flesh it out, and soon you have a draft. You send it to a friend for some edits. Go to page 18.
-----
<i>Page 18: Your computer is out of memory, so you have to transfer everything to your portable hard drive. You find a folder labeled “screenshots” and find pictures of your video calls with Tina. Sometimes, she’s holding something up to the camera, trying to show you something. Other times, you’re both making wacky faces, or posing, or just laughing. Some, you took just because you thought she looked extra beautiful.

<i>If you text Tina about the screenshots, go to page 19.

<i>Page 19: “just came across these today and thought of you,” you text. You attach a bunch of the pictures. “so cute!! we had such great times together huh,” she replies. “yes, I miss it! and you,” you say. “you know, I’m going to be in town in two weeks for a wedding. we should catch up,”  she says. “no way!! let’s do it. can’t wait!” you reply. You wonder if she’s still dating that guy. You wonder if they’re planning on getting married soon.
<i>Two weeks later, she arrives in town. You offer to pick her up at the airport. You hold up a sign with her name on it and stand with the chauffeurs. When she finally comes over from the baggage claim, she squints as she searches for you, and rolls her eyes when she finally sees you. “You dork,” are her first words when she comes within earshot. “That’s quite rude, Ms. Chou.” Then you hug for what seems like forever, but still isn’t long enough.
<i>Later, she drunkenly calls you from the wedding, and you go to pick her up. She sounds like she’s been crying, and when you arrive she’s sitting on the steps outside the church, her head in her hands. There are black smears on the back of her hand where she dabbed away her mascara. “Tina, hey.” You rush to sit beside her, and she leans on you. “What’s going on, are you okay?”
<i>“Yes everything is fine, I’m so sorry you have to see me like this. I just get like this when I’m drunk sometimes.” You both sit for a while. You get the sense that she doesn’t really want you to say anything, so you look at the stars, and then the grass, and then you follow the cars streaking by with your eyes, as their white headlights morph into red. The air is heavy with alcohol and you feel a bit nauseated. The music inside eventually starts to die down, and you hear people beginning to say their goodbyes. “We should get going soon, before everyone starts trying to get out of the driveway.”
<i>“Definitely.” She stands shakily, still leaning against you. “Where’s your hotel? I can drive you.”
<i>“No, I can’t inconvenience you anymore. I can Uber home, it’s no problem.” She shrugs you off and pulls out her phone. The light is blinding after so long staring at darkness, and you wince and look away.
<i>“It’s pretty late, I really think you shouldn’t be Ubering at this time,” you insist.
<i>“No, seriously, it’s fine. Go on home and get some rest.”
<i>“Tina, I think it’s not safe. It’s really not an issue to —“
<i>“Who are you, my mom?” Her tone is sharp enough to cut ice. “We’re not in high school anymore. Just let me handle it.” Your face must have betrayed your shock, because she quickly backtracks. “I’m sorry, it’s been a long night. You don’t have to take me home, but if it would make you feel better, I’m fine with it.”
<i>You don’t really feel like it anymore. You and Tina go on to be friends for many years. Later, when you recall this memory together, the last part never gets retold. Eventually, it’s lost forever. Go to page 20.
